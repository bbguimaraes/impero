impero
======

`impero` is a graphical command executor, intended to be used via a keyboard
shortcut.  Available commands are displayed and optionally filtered with the
contents of a text field.  When one is selected using `Tab/Shift-Tab` + `Enter`,
it is executed and the program exits.

Available commands are read from the positional arguments.

```sh
$ impero 'command 0' 'command 1' # â€¦
```

building
--------

Both `autotools` and `cmake` builds are supported.  `impero` uses Qt for the
graphical use interface.  The only dependencies are Qt's Core and Wigets
modules (see [`configure.ac`](./configure.ac) and
[`CMakeLists.txt`](./CMakeLists)).

```sh
$ # autotols build
$ ./configure && make
$ # cmake build
$ cmake -B . && make
```
